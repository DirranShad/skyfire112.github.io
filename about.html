					"The interactive mobile phone game uses GPS to place fictional Pokemon characters, which users then need to catch by physically attending a location.
					It has been linked to a spike in reports of trespassing, dangerous driving and other illegal behaviour.

					Police across Australia have urged users of the interactive mobile phone game to play safely, and warned it is not a defence against trespass.

					In Sydney yesterday, two teenagers were fined after allegedly being caught playing the game while driving.

					In Mount Isa in western Queensland on Wednesday, police called to reports of trespassing at a primary school found the popular Charmander character lurking outside the school's gates.

					Since its launch last week in Australia, its daily active users have overtaken dating app Tinder and is on track to reign supreme over Twitter."

				The basic point of Pokemon Go is to promote exercise while staring at your phone searching for pokemon.
				The left side of this page has been quoted from ABC news, that illegal behaviours have been found from people with the sole reason of "Catching Pokemon."
				</p>
				<p>
				Look at what this horrifying game has done to us! Making us tresspass random places, just to get the only charmander, lurking around schools. The only thing players do in pokemon go is to travel around, go to a certain area and throw pokeballs hoping that a single ball would be enough to catch it.
				</p>
				<p>
				"What is the point of this game?" Many have asked. Various answers have been made, that it is just an "advanced pokemon game", "exercise game", or "throwing pokeballs for fun". Is this really what the point of the game is? To throw poke'balls to innocent, bystanding pokemons? 
				<p>
				To see what else you can do to your game addicted life other than play this highly dangerous application, click the 'Games' section on this page. To see the unfortunate and obssessed humans who have fallen into this abyss of throwing pokeballs at pokemons click the 'videos' section.
